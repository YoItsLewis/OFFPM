# OFFPM
The Open Flexure Fourier Ptychographic Microscope (OFFPM) is a low-cost 3D printed super-resolution microscope. Using the original hardware framework of the Open Flexure Microscope, we have adapted the hardware, and open source softwares to construct a portable and compact super-resolution system.

The system uses a non-infinity corrected 10x/0.25 Comar objective, conventionally demonstrating a resolution of 1.27um (lambda = 363 nm) over a 1.33 mm diagonal field of view (FoV). However, by illuminating the sample at various angles using an array of LEDs and reconstructing using the Quasi-Newton Phase Retrieval algorithm for FPM, we are able to produce a sub-micron resolution ouput of 315 nm over a 1.22 mm diagonal FoV, allowing subcellular detail of many biological structures.
